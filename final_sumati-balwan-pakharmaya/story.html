        The Story of Bhupesh Chandrakant Indulikar: From a Village Boy to a Self-Made Success
        In 2009, a 10-year-old boy named Bhupesh Chandrakant Indulikar arrived at Pakharmaya, an orphanage in the
        village of Malvan, seeking a fresh start. Life had not been easy for Bhupesh, but his determination was
        unwavering.
        As he grew older, Bhupesh embarked on a path of self-improvement and resilience. He pursued a Mechanical ITI
        course and later completed IBT teaching training, which led him back to Sumati Balwan as a teacher. However,
        Bhupesh’s journey was far from ordinary; he took on the challenge of juggling three jobs in a single day. In the
        mornings, he would rise early to sell milk, then spend his days imparting knowledge as a teacher, and in the
        evenings, he would work at Dmart.
        This tireless routine was a testament to Bhupesh’s commitment to securing a better future for himself. His hard
        work and prudent savings eventually paid off, allowing him to purchase two flats and a car, and even finance his
        own wedding, covering all the expenses himself. Today, Bhupesh stands as a successful professional, a devoted
        husband, and a shining example of what determination and perseverance can achieve.
        His journey from a humble village boy to a self-made success story continues to inspire all who hear it,
        embodying the spirit of resilience that Pakharmaya fosters in its children.

        A girl who is probably stepping out of her teens now, whose age can only be guessed and surmised.
        A girl with a winning smile and a happy heart.
        A girl who loves life.

        And yet, life has not always been kind to her.
        An NGO rescued a group of small children begging on the streets of Pune, where they "worked" for a contractor
        who fed them barely enough to survive but plied them through the day with hallucinogenic drugs to make them do
        his bidding. This heartless man had been on the verge of sending some of the small girls for further
        exploitation of a horrendous type.
        They were rescued from his clutches in the nick of time.

        Seventeen years ago, three of these half-starved children were brought to Sumati Balwan and we took them in.
        Kajal was one of them.

        Had she been stolen from her parents some years ago by that cruel contractor? Or had she been abandoned?
        She knows not and nor do we.

        Ensconced securely in our care, she gradually overcame her physical and emotional handicaps and joined our other
        children in school.

        Over the years she blossomed into a strong and sturdy child. She immersed herself in Studies, she loved and
        excelled in Sports. She has won many medals in wall climbing ,participated at National level competitions.
        Today she is a volunteer coach to college students in adventure sports like rapelling.

        She is a good and industrious student too and has secured 76.5% in the HSc examination held this year.
        She now stands poised to take the next step and has started the first year of BCA.

        Aided by us, in January 2024 she completed Basic Mountaineering Course conducted by GGIM and passed it with an A
        Grade. She would now like to do a one-year Diploma in Mountaineering affiliated to the Savitribai Phule
        University of Pune.
        The fees for the Mountaineering course are Rs 90000/-and BCA : Rs.50000/-

        I am reaching out to you to ask, will you too, be willing to be a part of the incredible success story Kajal has
        scripted and worked hard for, in her life?
        Will you join us in celebrating and helping her future journey in life?
        A life which began as a fight for survival on the harsh streets of Pune but has overcome all odds to reach for
        the sky on a mountain top?

        In 2018, 10-year-old Sakshi Shinde was rescued from a life of hardship, having been abandoned by her family and
        left to suffer under the care of her alcoholic father. When she arrived at Pakhrmaya, an orphanage dedicated to
        giving hope to children without families, she carried the weight of a painful past. Though academics were a
        challenge for her, Sakshi discovered a fierce passion for sports, especially karate and kabaddi, where her
        determination and resilience quickly set her apart.
        Despite her struggles, Sakshi's dedication led her to excel in sports, winning gold at the state level and
        bronze at the national level in karate. Now in the 9th standard, she continues to thrive as a talented athlete,
        embodying the spirit of hope and perseverance. Sakshi Shinde’s journey from a vulnerable child to a celebrated

        In 2019, 5-year-old Jyoti was brought to Pakharmaya after her mother,
        desperate to escape the relentless beatings and abuse by her husband,
        sought refuge for her daughter. Pakharmaya, a sanctuary for orphaned and
        vulnerable children, became the safe haven where Jyoti finally found the

        her to secure a silver medal at the state level and a bronze at the
        national level in kickboxing, filling everyone at Pakharmaya with pride.
        Jyoti's story is a powerful testament to resilience and the
        transformative power of a caring community. It proves that even the most
        vulnerable can rise above their circumstances and achieve greatness.
